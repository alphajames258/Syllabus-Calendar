Office:   C416  
Phone number:  305.284.5183

I.  Course Description and Objectives 
Legal Communication and Research Skills II will help you continue to develop 
your  reasoning,  writing,  research,  and  oral  argument  skills  in  the  context  of  client 
advocacy.   This   course   builds   on   the   foundational   skills   taught   in   Legal 
Communication  and  Research  Skills  I,  moving  away  from predictive writing  and 
toward persuasive written and oral advocacy. You will write and give oral argument 
on pretrial and appellate briefs. You will learn how to prepare documents tailored to 
the demands of contemporary legal practice, research advanced legal issues, interact 
with clients and colleagues, and collaborate with colleagues to achieve the best result 
for  the  client.  You  will also receive  training  in  professionalism,  oral  advocacy,  and 
other essential communication skills. 
This  course  uses  reading  materials,  lectures,  in-class  activities,  writing 
assignments,  research  exercises,  detailed  individualized  feedback,  meetings  with 
faculty, observation of court proceedings, and other tools to help you learn the skills 
crucial to effective lawyering. 
II.  How to Succeed in LComm 
A. Attendance 
This is a learning-by-doing class, so punctual attendance at all classroom (and 
potentially online) classes and conferences is required. Any unexcused absence may 
adversely affect your grade. Because the American Bar Association requires regular 

2 
 
and punctual class attendance, missing more than twenty percent of class meetings 
may  preclude  you  from  earning  credit  for  this  course.  Conferences  with  me  are 
considered class meetings. If you miss a class, you are responsible for all materials, 
announcements, and assignments covered. 
 
Extended  Absences:  Students  who  miss  class  for  five  days  or  more  should 
complete an  absence  form  with  the  Dean  of  Students (her email  address  is  
deanofstudents@law.miami.edu). The Dean of Students will notify faculty members 
of extended absences, working with faculty to make sure that we support our students 
who  may  be  affected  by  extended  illness  or  absences  due  to  compliance  with 
University public health protocols.  
  
B. Professionalism and Class Participation 
“I revere the law, the judicial system, and the legal profession, and will at all 
times  in  my  professional  and  private  lives  uphold  the  dignity  and  esteem  of  each.”  
Creed of Professionalism, The Florida Bar. 
As  you  learned  in  Legal  Communication  and  Research  Skills  I,  you  are  a 
professional  in  training.  You  should  continue  to  display  your  commitment  to  the 
ideals and values of professionalism. Throughout this semester, you will participate 
in   discussions   and   exercises   designed   to   reinforce   the   importance   of   legal 
professionalism. Your final grade includes a component for professionalism and class 
participation, with the expectation that you will do all of the following: 
1. Attend all meetings (e.g., classes, conferences, and oral arguments) and 
be punctual; 
2. Prepare for classes by completing all reading and writing assignments; 
3. Participate actively in classroom discussions, out-of-class activities, and 
group work;  
4. Complete and submit all assignments by the established deadlines; 
5. Proofread  and  edit  your  writing  to  ensure  compliance  with  format 
requirements, word limits, citation rules, etc.;  
6. Show  respect  and  civility  when  giving  and  receiving  feedback  or 
otherwise communicating  with  faculty,  guest  practitioners,  and  fellow 
students; 
7. Make  a  good-faith  effort  and  follow  the  directions  on  all  assignments, 
whether graded or ungraded; and  
8. Use laptops, phones, and other electronic devices only as permitted. 
 
C. Ungraded Assignments 
You  will  complete  several  ungraded  assignments designed  to  help  you  learn 
how to be an effective advocate. You must write your own assignments without any 

3 
 
assistance  from  others. You  may  not  read,  review,  or  proofread another  student’s 
assignment.  If  you  have any questions about  the  course  or  any  assignment,  you 
should speak with me. 
A lawyer  must  always  do  his  or  her  best  work.  You  must make  a  good-faith 
effort and follow the instructions for all assignments, whether graded or ungraded.  
Failure to demonstrate a good-faith effort on an ungraded assignment can result in a 
deduction  of  your  final  grade  for  the  course.  Ungraded  assignments  for  this  course 
include the following: 
1. Partial Motion to Dismiss or Opposition; 
2. Complete Motion to Dismiss or Opposition; and   
3. Oral Argument on Motion or Opposition.  
D. Graded Assignments 
Your  final  grade  this  semester  will  be based  on your  performance  on  the 
following: (1) professionalism   and   class   participation;   (2)   research report   to 
supervising  attorney; (3) final appellate  brief; and (4) oral  argument  on final brief. 
More specifically, your grade for this semester will be determined as follows:  
Professionalism and Class 
Participation 
15% 
Report to Supervising Attorney  Pass/Fail 
Appellate Brief 70% 
Final Oral Argument  15% 
 
E. Deadlines  
Each  assignment  must  be  submitted by  the  prescribed  deadline.  In  law 
practice, time management and adherence to deadlines are essential. Indeed, missing 
a deadline may amount to legal malpractice. 
Accordingly, students who submit a late assignment may forfeit the opportunity 
to receive my critique or to meet with me regarding their assignment, or they may face 
other penalties. I may make exceptions for legitimate and serious emergencies. If an 
emergency arises, such as a documented illness or a death in the family, request an 
extension  from  me  as  soon  as  you learn of  the  emergency.    Retroactive extension 
requests will not be considered. 
III.     Contact Information  
My  office is  located  in  C416  (on  the  fourth  floor  on  the  North  side  of  the 
building). You may contact me at 305-284-5183 or atorres@law.miami.edu. Email is 

4 
 
the fastest and most reliable way to contact me. I will strive to respond to your email 
within a reasonable timeframe; however, you should not expect me to respond after 
5:00 p.m. or on weekends. Please note that I may not respond to inquiries about an 
assignment during the twenty-four hours before the assignment is due, as you should 
be in the final proofreading stage by that time. 
Emails in the professional context are like business letters. Before you send an 
email to me, other professors, administrators, staff, or other students, make sure it 
is  professional  in  content  and  tone. Before  asking  a  question  by  email,  review  the 
Syllabus  or  relevant  class  materials  to  determine  if  the  answer  has  already  been 
provided.     
 
IV.  Texts 
Required 
1. The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation (21st ed. 2020).  
2. Jill Barton and Rachel Smith, The Handbook for the New Legal Writer

V. Collaboration, Plagiarism, and the Honor Code 
You  must  review  and  abide by  the  School  of  Law’s  Honor  Code  for  all 
assignments.  Plagiarism  is  an  honor  code  violation  that  may  result  in  penalties, 
including  suspension or  expulsion. Do  not  accept  assistance,  give  assistance,  or 
collaborate on any assignments, whether graded or ungraded, except as permitted. If 
you are in doubt about whether an action violates this policy, please ask me first. 
VI. Blackboard & TWEN   
I  will  post materials  on  the course Blackboard  page.  You  should  visit  the 
Blackboard page regularly and be prepared to access any posted documents during 
our class meetings. Note that you will post your writing assignments and register for 
individual conferences on the course TWEN page.

VII. Laptops and Electronic Devices 
Laptops and tablets are permitted in class; however, you may use them solely 
for legitimate class purposes. Improper use of laptops or other devices during class 
may  result  in  a  deduction  to  your  professionalism  grade  or  other  penalties.  Cell 
phones must be on silent and put away during class. If you have an emergency and 
are waiting for a call or message, please notify me before class begins.     
 
VIII. Academic Integrity and Intellectual Property 
Students are expressly prohibited from recording any class meeting or other 
part  of  this  course. Professor  Torres  is  the  copyright  owner  of  the  courseware. 
Individual copies  or recordings  of  the  materials posted on  Blackboard  and/or  class 
sessions  are  not  allowed.  Such  materials  cannot  be  shared  outside  the  physical  or 
virtual classroom environment.  
IX. Peer Review 
Law school is a place of ideas. In our classroom, I expect all students to express 
and respond to ideas freely and respectfully, without fear of negative treatment from 
faculty or peers. Exchanging constructive criticism with peers is essential in any law 
practice, and such criticism should reflect a spirit of collaboration and education. 
X. Wellness, Disabilities, and Title IX 
The University of Miami School of Law is committed to creating an inclusive 
learning environment that meets the needs of our diverse student body. If you have 
a  disability  (including  physical  or  mental  health  challenges)  and  need  academic 
accommodations,   please   contact   Student   Accessibility   Services   via   email   at 
access@law.miami.edu.   Please   note   that   accommodations   are   not   retroactive; 
students are encouraged to contact the office and inquire about any disability-related 
needs within the first weeks of the semester.

environment free from discrimination based upon gender or sex. This includes all 
types of sexual misconduct including but not limited to: Dating Violence, Domestic 
Violence, Sexual Assault (including Sexual Battery), Sexual Exploitation, Sexual

discrimination. For additional information about the University’s Title IX policies,

community. This policy is designed to create a welcoming and inclusive environment 
for all students, including those who identify as transgender, non-binary, or gender 
nonconforming. Students have the right to be addressed by a name, gender marker, 
and  set  of  gender  pronouns  that  correspond  to  the  student’s  gender  identity.  A 
student’s legal name and gender must be used in the following instances: Transcripts

Applications,   Health   Insurance   and   Legal   Medical   Documents,   Financial   Aid
